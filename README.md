This repository contains the following files. The version of PYTHON used is 3.7:

(a) SIL-Task1&2.py: This PYTHON file needs as input the BibTex file 'source.bib' which can be downloaded and saved from the following site:

https://cdstar.shh.mpg.de/bitstreams/EAEA0-9478-C22F-4AAF-0/glottolog_source.bib.zip.

Upon running the file 'SIL-Task1&2.py' in PYTHON, the output obtained is the large CSV file 'out.csv'. To run 'SIL-Task1&2.py' in PYTHON, execute the command 'python SIL-Task1&2.py'. Note: The source file 'source.bib' must be in the same folder or directory in which 'SIL-Task1&2.py' is being run on PYTHON or a path to the folder containing 'source.bib' will need to be provided.


(b) SIL-Task3.py: This PYTHON file needs as input the file 'out.csv' from part (a) above. Upon running the file in the PYTHON programming language, the CSV file 'out.csv' is rendered to a database named 'bibleSource' which can be queried using any SQL. An SQL query, that prints the total number of records in 'bibleSource', is run in this program to make sure the data is loaded correctly into the database. To run 'SIL-Task3.py' in PYTHON, run the command 'python SIL-Task3.py'. Note: The CSV file 'out.csv' will need to be in the same folder or directory in which 'SIL-Task3.py' is being run on PYTHON or a path to the folder containing 'out.csv' will need to be provided.


(c) QualityIssues.pdf: This PDF file describes some of the quality issues observed in the data along with potential methodologies for dealing with these quality issues.
